# About

Welcome to my blog! I’m Shubham Pandey a curious human being and a software engineer. My journey into the world of engineering has taken me deep into the realms of Linux, operating systems, networking, databases, and the intricacies of the JVM.

Here on my blog, I share my learnings, explorations, and insights into the fascinating architecture of software systems. I hope my stories and technical deep-dives inspire you to explore, learn, and question.

Let’s embark on this journey of discovery together!
